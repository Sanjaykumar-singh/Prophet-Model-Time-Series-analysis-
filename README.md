Here’s a **clean README.md** you can use for your uploaded **Prophet model** project:

# 📈 Stock Price Forecasting using Prophet  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies **Facebook Prophet** to forecast stock prices based on historical time series data.  
Prophet is designed to handle **trend, seasonality, and holiday effects**, making it highly suitable for financial datasets that show periodic fluctuations and long-term growth patterns.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source:** Historical stock closing prices.  
- **Key Columns (Prophet format):**  
  - `ds` → Date column  
  - `y` → Stock closing price  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. Load and preprocess stock price data.  
2. Convert into Prophet’s expected format (`ds`, `y`).  
3. Fit a Prophet model on the dataset.  
4. Generate a **future dataframe** and forecast stock prices.  
5. Visualize:  
   - Forecast curve with confidence intervals  
   - Trend component  
   - Seasonal components  

---

## 📊 Observations  
- Prophet effectively captures **underlying trend and repeating seasonal patterns** in stock prices.  
- The forecast provides **upper and lower confidence bounds**, helping assess uncertainty in predictions.  
- The model adapts well to missing data and irregularities in time series.

2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Prophet model.ipynb"
   ```

3. (Optional) Fetch live stock data using `yfinance`:

   ```python
   import yfinance as yf
   df = yf.download("IBM", start="2015-01-01", end="2025-01-01")
   df = df.reset_index()[["Date","Close"]]
   df.columns = ["ds","y"]
   ```

4. Train and forecast:

   ```python
   from prophet import Prophet
   model = Prophet()
   model.fit(df)
   future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=365)
   forecast = model.predict(future)
   model.plot(forecast)
   ```

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Compare Prophet with **ARIMA/SARIMA** and deep learning models (e.g., **LSTM**).
* Add **external regressors** (e.g., trading volume, macroeconomic indicators).
* Deploy results on a **dashboard (Streamlit/Power BI)** for interactive analysis.
